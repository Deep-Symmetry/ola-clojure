# ola-clojure

<image align="right" width="275"
src="doc/assets/ola-clojure-padded-left.png"> A
[Clojure](http://clojure.org) library for communicating with the
[Open Lighting Architecture](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/).

[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)
are used to efficiently communicate with the `olad` daemon via its
[RPC Service](https://docs.openlighting.org/doc/latest/rpc_system.html).

This project was extracted from
[Afterglow](https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow#afterglow), so that
other Clojure projects could communicate with OLA without having to
pull in all of Afterglow.

### Documentation Overview

To be fleshed out.

## Usage

1. If you haven't already,
   [Install OLA](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/getting-started/downloads/).
   (On the Mac I recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) which lets
   you simply `brew install ola`). Once you launch the `olad` server
   you can interact with its embedded
   [web server](http://localhost:9090/ola.html), which is very helpful
   in seeing whether anything is working; you can even watch live DMX
   values changing.

2. Set up a Clojure project using [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) or [Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot#boot--).

3. Add this project as a dependency:
   [![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/ola-clojure/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/ola-clojure)

## Status

This has been used without any changes since the beginning of the
Afterglow project, although it was only recently separated into its
own project.

## Bugs

Although there are none known as of the time of this release, please
log [issues](https://github.com/brunchboy/ola-clojure/issues) as you
encounter them!
